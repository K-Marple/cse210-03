# Jumper
It's like Hangman but with a parachuter! Jumper might look like an easy game, but you could end up flat on the ground. 
The rules:
Guess a letter in a secret word. If it's right the letter will appear on the plank. If it's wrong you lose a part of your parachute! If the whole parachute disappears, you die. If you guess the word, you win.

## Project Stucture
The project files and folders are organized as such:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- jumper              (source code for the game)
    +-- game            (specific classes)
    +-- __main__.py     (program entry point)
+-- README.md           (general information)
```
